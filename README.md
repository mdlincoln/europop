Historical populations of European cities, 1500-1800, as compiled by Jan De Vries, *European Urbanization, 1500-1800* (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984), Appendix I.

With this package, I have also included a table of coordinates for each city, as well as a shapefile of the European coastline derived from [OpenStreetMapData](http://openstreetmapdata.com/data/generalized-coastlines)
