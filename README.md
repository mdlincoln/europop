Historical populations of European cities, 1500-1800, as compiled by Jan De Vries, *European Urbanization, 1500-1800* (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984), Appendix I.

The original tables as published in De Vries 1984 are available in [`data-raw/extracted`](https://github.com/mdlincoln/europop/tree/master/data-raw/extracted), with the tidied version available in [`data-raw/europop.csv`](https://github.com/mdlincoln/europop/blob/master/data-raw/europop.csv)

With this package, I have also included a table of coordinates for each city in [`data-raw/city_coords.csv`](https://github.com/mdlincoln/europop/blob/master/data-raw/city_coords.csv).
A shapefile of the European coastline derived from [OpenStreetMapData](http://openstreetmapdata.com/data/generalized-coastlines) is also included in [`inst/extdata/eur_coast`](https://github.com/mdlincoln/europop/tree/master/inst/extdata/eur_coast)
